How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Good tool, but not convenient enough

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help a lot.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: commit size and its meaning can be managable
    Cons: potential user errors can be introduced

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Becuase multiple files can be affected by the same changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can check and find "commit messages" and all details of the changes made to each commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can check all the git commit history and changes made so that I can go back to previous commit to find where the bug got added

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use Git for my source code management
